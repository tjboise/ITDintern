## Week1 Jun. 20 ~ Jun. 25

### ðŸŒ²Environment set up
- [x] GPU driver installment
- [ ] Install Cuda: It is a necessary for the pytorch to use the GPU in laptop which would make training faster -->need permission from ITD
- [x] Install Pytorch
- [x] Install some image related packages

### ðŸŒ³download all images
- [x] write a [python script](https://github.com/tjboise/ITDintern/blob/main/dataset%20construct.ipynb) based on David's code to download [pictures](https://511.idaho.gov/#:MyRoutes).
