#### Data clearning: 
Remove pictures without any cars. It is a very important step before we annotate the images. 
- If there are too many pictures without car, it will cause a waste in labor as we have to look through so many pictures without car. 
- Also, it is meaningless to the model. only the images with car can improve the model performance.

- [x] All the images on July 4th: 13386

-> after removing some broken file and pictures with no car, an amount of 4930 is left.

-> upload it to the app.cvat.ai
